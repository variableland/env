 * no `NODE_ENV` / `VITE_ENV` and falls back to `"development"` without this inject.
 * That's why the plugin is required for any non-development browser build — not
 * just custom modes like `staging` / `qa` (which Vite would otherwise flatten by
 * forcing `NODE_ENV="production"` regardless of `--mode`).
